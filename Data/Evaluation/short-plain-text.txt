Nicholas Christakis explores how the largescale face to face social networks in which we are embedded affect our lives and what we can do to take advantage of this fact. People aren`t merely social animals in the usual sense for we don`t just live in groups. We live in networks and we have done so ever since we emerged from the African savanna. Via intricately branching paths tracing out cascading family connections, friendship ties, and work relationships we are interconnected to hundreds or thousands of specific people most of whom we do not know. We affect them and they affect us. Nicholas Christakis` work examines the biological psychological sociological and mathematical rules that govern how we form these social networks and the rules that govern how they shape our lives. His work shows how phenomena as diverse as obesity, smoking, emotions, ideas, germs and altruism can spread through our social ties and how genes can partially underlie our creation of social ties to begin with. His work also sheds light on how we might take advantage of an understanding of social networks to make the world a better place. At Harvard, Christakis is a Professor of Medicine, Health Care Policy and sociology and he directs a diverse research group investigating social networks.
